            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Matthew Lewis, I recently graduated with a First Class Honours BSc in Data Science from the University of Exeter and am now 
                pursuing an MSc in Health Data Science at UCL. My passion lies at the intersection of data, AI and health, where I aim to leverage data-driven 
                solutions to transform healthcare. In my free time I also enjoy spending time at the gym, cycling and have recently started to learn the piano.

                <p>
                    Despite the significant technological advancements which have been introduced in the consumer
                    sales sector, the Business-to-Business (B2B) sector has lagged behind in adopting new technologies. 
                    This has resulted in the majority of these processes being slow and reliant on human expertise. 
                    This paper examines the implementation of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the efficiency and
                    quality of matching Request for Quotations with suitable suppliers in a B2B supply chain procurement
                    platform. By leveraging LLM vector embeddings and similarity metrics such as cosine similarity,
                    we significantly improve the efficiency of the entity matching processes taking place in these
                    procurement platforms. Through comprehensive experimentation, with the use of various models and
                    approaches, we demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMs within the domain. We develop a system
                    capable of matching RFQs to appropriate suppliers within seconds from a pool of hundreds of
                    companies. With the top-performing model, on average ranking the correct supplier as the
                    second most probable and achieving a success rate of 47.9% in identifying the supplier
                    selected by a procurement agent, we clearly demonstrate the real-world suitability of
                    LLMs to this task. Furthermore, we provide a comparison of the use of open versus closed
                    source LLMs and assess the advantages and disadvantages that such models present.
                    Overall, this paper provides an in-depth analysis of the successful integration of LLMs
                    into the procurement sector, providing insights into improving the efficiency and quality
                    of B2B supply chain procurement platforms.

                <p>
                    This project was completed as part of the COM3023 module at the University of Exeter. 
                    This paper aims to investigate the implementation of Bayesian Neural Networks, in particular their
                    use in assessing the uncertainty within Neural Network model parameters.
                    It makes use of approximation methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Variational Inference
                    in order to implement this Bayesian approach. Through the use of the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset,
                    we see how such methods are implemented and what benefits they may hold. We also compare
                    the two methods in order to provide an overview of the key differences and capabilities they hold.

                <p>
                    This project was part of the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started" target="_blank">Kaggle NLP Getting Started</a> competition.
                    It involves building a model to predict whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not. The project includes data preprocessing,
                    feature extraction, and model training using various NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms. The best performing model used a fine-tuned LLM and achieved an accuracy placed in the top 10% 
                    of the Kaggle competition leaderboard.

                    This project was completed as part of the ECM3412 module at the University of Exeter. 
                    The project involved implementing an Ant Colony Optimisation algorithm to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem.
                    This project includes Python code containing functions and algorithms for ACO-based TSP solving.
                    It provides functionalities for reading in the data, generating ant paths, updating pheromones, and running the
                    ACO algorithm with different configurations including standard ACO, MMAS, and Elitist.
